# Abstractive_text-_summarisation

Abstractive Summarization
This is a very interesting approach. Here, we generate new sentences from the original text. This is in contrast to the extractive approach we saw earlier where 
we used only the sentences that were present. The sentences generated through abstractive summarization might not be present in the original text.
